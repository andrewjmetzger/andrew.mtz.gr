Plex cannot connect securely. Go to https://app.plex.tv/ > Settings
Server shows as "Cannot connect securely"

This is due to DNS rebinding protections. 

Plex's article https://support.plex.tv/articles/206225077-how-to-use-secure-server-connections/ had a "pfSense" section; I searched for an opnSense solution and found: https://www.reddit.com/r/OPNsenseFirewall/comments/xwjxe0/unbound_dns_rebind_for_plexdirect_not_working/izztf7m/.


On OPNSense 22.7.9, I navigated to Services > Unbound DNS > Advanced.

I scrolled down to "Private Domains"

I added `plex.direct` to "Private Domains"

I hit Apply, then restarted the service.

Next I reloaded the Plex Web App in my browser, and boom - direct secure connection with the playback quality I expected on a LAN!
